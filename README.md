# Qur’an — Focus Mode

This is not a typical Qur’an website.

The text is visible **only while you are present**.
If you leave — it disappears.
When you return — it continues.

## Why
Reading requires presence.
This project makes absence visible.

## Features
- 📖 Full Qur’an via free AlQuran Cloud API
- 🎧 Ayah audio playback
- 👁 Presence-based focus (camera, optional)
- 🌙 Minimal, distraction-free UI
- 🧠 No AI, no tracking, no uploads

## Privacy
- Camera is processed **locally**
- No images or video are stored or sent anywhere

## Demo
Enable GitHub Pages and open `index.html` over HTTPS.

## API
- https://alquran.cloud/api

> Presence is part of reading.
